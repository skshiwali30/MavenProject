			<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
			<br> <br>
			<p>An airline is a company that provides air transport services
				for traveling passengers and freight. Airlines utilize aircraft to
				supply these services, and may form partnerships or alliances with
				other airlines for codeshare agreements. Generally, airline
				companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or
				license issued by a governmental aviation body.</p>

			<br><br><h1>Ticket Revenue</h1>

				<p>Diagram of an airline Global Distribution System Airlines
					assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize
					profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become
					increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely
					determined by computerized yield management systems.</p><br>
				<p>Because of the complications in scheduling flights and
					maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be
					used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets
					are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines
					are forced to make constant adjustments.</p><br>
				<p>Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of price
					discrimination, to sell air services at varying prices
					simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price
					include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor,
					the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in
					force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of
					day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the
					aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of travel
					classes for pricing purposes.</p><br>
					<p> A complicating factor is that of
					origin-destination control ("O&D control"). Someone purchasing a
					ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is
					competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los
					Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to
					pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the
					$200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing
					to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of
					similar pricing decisions daily.</p><br>
					<p> The advent of advanced
					computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably
					Sabre, allowed airlines to easily perform cost-benefit analyses on
					different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price
					discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an
					aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving
					the consumer elsewhere).</p><br>
					<p> The intense nature of airfare pricing has
					led to the term "fare war" to describe efforts by airlines to
					undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers,
					new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the
					airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the
					Airline Tariff Publishing Company (ATPCO), who distribute latest
					fares for more than 500 airlines to Computer Reservation Systems
					across the world.</p>
